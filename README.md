## Deployment

To develop this widget locally, you need [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), fast, disk space efficient package manager.

Other aspects of deployment are pretty trivial:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev # see your console for port. Also accessible in your local network
```

To build the widget simply:

```sh
pnpm build # see ./dist folder
```

You can also preview it to make sure that everything is fine:

```sh
pnpm preview # like with dev command, check out your console output for the port
```
